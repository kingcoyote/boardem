About
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Board'em is a single player fast paced collection game written in Unity for
the web. It is the result of a very boring weekend and a desire to do something.
Anything.

Game
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use the arrow keys (or WASD) to move your piece (the blue disk). Your objective
is to gather all of the green tokens that spawn. You have 6 seconds to get each
token. If you run out of time, you will fail.

Each time you pick up a token, the wall turrets will change. Some will enable
and some will disable. The more tokens you pick up, the more turrets will become
active.
